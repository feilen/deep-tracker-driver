[x] Get an example DCGAN working
[ ] Customize example for mocap use
  - Should use the 'less into more' stacking like the example, but
  - should stack e.g. XinXout, XinYout, XinZout etc as the part that expands
  - so the skeletal tracking info is based on more and more specific locations

  - probably just use LSTM layers - no conv2dlayers required
[ ] Make BVH import/export workable
[ ] Load module into frugallydeep
[ ] Use frugallydeep to integrate into steamvr driver
