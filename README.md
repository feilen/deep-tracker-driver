# (wip!) deep-tracker-driver: An experimental SteamVR driver using deep learning to create virtual trackers

(description TODO)

Designed for use with the 3dsmax-converted CMU motion capture database, but should be fine with any BVH database: https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/the-3dsmax-friendly-bvh-release-of-cmus-motion-capture-database

Thanks to 
- https://github.com/terminal29/Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial/ for the initial driver code
- CMU for the capture database
- Keras-team [Amogh Joshi](https://github.com/amogh7joshi) for the initial training sample
